(1) Anything positive you enjoyed or learned from this assignment:

Being able to apply the perceptron and actually learn from it hands on. 
Seeing what it can bring to the table and seeing the actual impact of it in action.


(2) Anything negative you didn't like about this assignment:
None

(3) Any parts of this assignment you found easy:
None


(4) Any parts of this assignment you found challenging or couldn't get working correctly:
Task 2 was one of the harder parts of the assignment considering we needed to have them the data run until all errors were zero.
We needed to put more on the table for this part and make sure everything worked out correctly in the end.


(5) How the team functioned:

We held regular meetings to brainstorm and design the code and to review our progress. We split the work among us evenly.

With the actual production of our project we were able to successful meet up and figure out the roles for each of the individuals. 
Creating different roles for each person and breaking up the task to where to move on from there. 

Vihan and Amulya worked on the algorithm

Gordon and Yuriy worked the actual file reading in and the write up file. 

(6) Any other remarks you want to make
