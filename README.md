# Authors: Vihan Patel, Gordon Petry, Amulya Badineni, Yuriy Deyneka

## FILES

  1. experiment.py - contains basic functions that will be used by project4.py to complete tasks 2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2
  2. project4.py - generates all the material needed for D2, D3 and D4
  3. perceptron.py - contains functions needed for perceptron learning, used by project4.py
  4. iris.data - will serve as input file for project4.py
  5. D2 - folder containing an epoch stats file and plots needed for task 2, generated by project4.py
  6. D3 - folder containing plots and epoch stats files needed for task 3, generated by project4.py
  7. D4 - folder containing plots and epoch stats files needed for task 4, generated by project4.py
  8. D5.pdf - contains reports needed for D5
  9. D6 - a file containing writeup needed for D6

## Steps for running source code

``` 
   NOTE: Look over D5.pdf before running any source code. D5.pdf analyzes material from folders D2, D3 and D4. 
   If you run the source code, then D2, D3 and D4 will have new material that D5.pdf does not analyze.
   
   1. Figure out the absolute path for a folder called Perceptron. 
   2. Type 'cd @', where @ represents the absolute path for a folder called Perceptron. Press the return key.
   3. Type ‘module add python’ and press the return key.
   4. Type 'python3 project4.py $ #', where $ represents the relative or absolute path to iris.data and 
      # is a decimal representing a learning rate (i.e. 0.1).
   5. If you have not done so, press the return key.
```
